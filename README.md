# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Predictor

This project is a **machine learning-based web application** that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health parameters such as age, BMI, glucose level, blood pressure, and more. It leverages a trained model and provides an easy-to-use interface built using **Streamlit**.

## 🔍 Features
- Predicts diabetes risk using a pre-trained ML model
- Clean and interactive user interface with Streamlit
- Accepts input for key health indicators
- Displays prediction results instantly
- Lightweight and deployable on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Streamlit  
- Joblib (for model serialization)

## 🚀 Deployment
Easily deployable with Streamlit sharing or any cloud platform. Just clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-risk-predictor.git
cd diabetes-risk-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run diabetes_app.py
